0.0,"The year-over-year growth for January was calculated to be infinite (inf). This means that the total forecasted sales for January 2024 (total_current_year) was significantly higher than the total forecasted sales for January 2023 (total_previous_year), which was 0.0. The growth percentage is infinite because the previous year's total was 0, resulting in a division by zero scenario. This indicates a substantial increase in sales from the previous year to the current year for the month of January."
"197249.0, 0.0","The year-over-year growth for January was calculated based on the total Base Forecast for January of 2024 and 2023. In this case, the total Base Forecast for January 2024 was 197249.0 units, while for January 2023, it was 0.0 units. 

Since the previous year's total was 0, the year-over-year growth is calculated as infinite (inf) because the denominator is 0. This means that there was no data available for January 2023, so the growth from 2023 to 2024 cannot be accurately calculated."
"197249.0, 122.67","The year-over-year growth for January was calculated to be 'nan' (which stands for Not a Number). This means that there was no valid year-over-year growth rate calculated for January. The total base forecast for January was 197249.0 units, with an average base forecast of approximately 122.67 units. The absence of a year-over-year growth value suggests that there might not have been data available for the previous year to compare with the current January data."

inf,"The year-over-year growth for January was calculated using the 'Base Forecast' column in the dataset. 

In this case, the year-over-year growth was calculated for January between the years 2023 and 2024. The total 'Base Forecast' for January 2024 was 197249.0, and for January 2023, it was 0.0. 

The formula used to calculate year-over-year growth is ((current year total - previous year total) / previous year total) * 100. 

In this specific scenario, since the previous year total was 0.0, the calculation resulted in 'inf' (infinity) for the year-over-year growth. This is because the growth rate is being calculated relative to a base of 0, which mathematically results in infinity. 

Therefore, the year-over-year growth for January in this dataset is 'inf'."
